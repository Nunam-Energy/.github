We at Nunam, an Indo-Germanic start-up, are focusing on building solutions for a sustainable future where we don't end up with toxic, hazardous e-waste from used li-ion batteries and making energy access universal with our 2nd life energy storage system enabling a circular economy with continuous intelligent monitoring and advanced analytics.

We have built a highly fault-tolerant, responsive platform data acquisition in high frequency from IoT-enabled devices and run non-parametric learning algorithms for insight engineering and delivering actionable insights.

With a multi-pronged approach, we are determined to solve the critical problem of unsustainable toxic waste of li-ion batteries.
